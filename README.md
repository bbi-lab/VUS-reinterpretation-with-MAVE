# VUS_manuscript

This repository contains a python script and corresponding .csv files for the TP53 naive Bayes classifier and an R markdown file with corresponding .csv files to generate the figures from the manuscript. 

To run the TP53 naive Bayes classifier, you will have to create a directory for the .csv files and give the path to this directory in the python script. When you run the script, output files and figures will be saved to the same directory. 

To generate the figures, you will again have to create a directory for the figure .csv files and give the path to this directory for each files in the R markdown. When you run the script, the figures will save a .pdf files in that same directory.
